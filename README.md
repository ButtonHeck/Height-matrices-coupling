# Height matrices coupling app
Application developed using Qt 5 and OpenGL as one of the test assignments I've done in 2019.
The main purpose is to arrange two matrices (so-called "master" and "target") by a chosen side. Matrices are generated randomly with a given dimensions and precision. In order to arrange target matrix it should at least precise as the master matrix.
Upper side of the GUI represents views for generated matrices and their control elements. In bottom-left corner is a profile view that shows closeup view of both matrices arrangement sides. The bottom-right shows both original and arranged profiles of the target matrix.
